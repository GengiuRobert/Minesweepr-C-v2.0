# Minesweepr-C-v2.0
Personal remake of the game Minesweeper in C, version 2.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------

In this version in read the dates about the game from a text file

Every row in the text file is gonna be like  -->  h  w  n  bombs_columns  bombs_rows

Where h -> number of rows of the Minesweeper table

Where w -> number of columns of the Minesweeper table

Where n -> number of the bombs placed on the Minesweeper table

Where bombs_columns -> a string of n characters that represent the columns for each bomb, 1 elemnt of the string is associated with one of the bombs

Where bombs_rows -> the index of each columns for an associated bomb

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Also, there you can see that for every table of Minesweeper, is calculated the dispersion value which ( hash(s) )
